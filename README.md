# DashboardPlugin

This will act as a temporary location to retrieve the most up to date dll file.
The dll file is a Rocket League plugin made to accompany the CANA overlay. It passes in additional data, alllowing users to
display flip-availability for players (as a spectator only)
The overlay will work without DLL file, but the flip indicators will not be functional.
